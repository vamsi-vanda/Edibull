Kent Nagle Lecture featuring Michele Mosca, Professor in the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. \\n\\nEvent is in C.W. Young Building - Room 206 \\n\\nAbout the lecture: \\nWe have since moved from being curious spectators of the quantum realm to active participants, intricately choreographing quantum effects to achieve specific objectives. We harness quantum effects for precise measurement, more powerful computation, more secure communication, and many more applications yet to be discovered.\\n\\nHowever, quantum computers will break some of the most important tools currently protecting cyberspace. Before reaping the benefits of full-scale quantum computation, we must retool with new cryptographic foundations for cybersecurity designed to be safe in the quantum era. \\n\\nThere are great challenges and opportunities as a growing global effort seeks to ensure that we have strong tools in place to protect our digital information and cyber systems in the quantum age.\\n\\n\\nMore about the Speaker: \\n\\nMichele Mosca is co-founder of the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, a Professor in the Department of Combinatorics & Optimization of the Faculty of Mathematics, and a founding member of Waterloo’s Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. He is the co-founder and Director of CryptoWorks21, an NSERC-funded training program in quantum-safe cryptography. He co-founded the ETSI-IQC workshop series in Quantum-Safe Cryptography which brings together a broad range of stakeholders working toward globally standardized quantum-safe cryptography. He co-founded evolutionQ Inc. in order to support organizations as they evolve their quantum-vulnerable systems and practices to quantum-safe ones.\\n\\nHe obtained his doctorate in Mathematics in 1999 from the University of Oxford on the topic of Quantum Computer Algorithms.\\nHis research interests include quantum computation and cryptographic tools that will be safe against quantum technologies.\\nHe is globally recognized for his drive to help academia, industry and government prepare our cyber systems to be safe in an era with quantum computers.\\n\\nDr. Mosca’s work is published widely in top journals, and he co-authored the respected textbook “An Introduction to Quantum Computing” (OUP). Dr. Mosca has won numerous academic awards and honors, including 2010 Canada’s Top 40 Under 40, the Premier’s Research Excellence Award (2000-2005), Fellow of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) since 2010, Canada Research Chair in Quantum Computation (2002-2012), University Research Chair at the University of Waterloo (2012-present), and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2013).', 'USF College of Arts and Sciences', '140089599334463']\n",

This year we are also collaborating with the Pre-Physician Assistant Society to expand the medical school forum to include medical schools as well as PA schools. Schools are invited from all over the country to attend, and their representatives give informational presentations on various aspects of their Medical School, everything from how a prospective student might increase their acceptance chances to life as medical students at their school. Along with this, there will also be representatives for various medical programs that offer alternative routes/options in entering into the medical field.  This is an incredible opportunity suitable for many audiences, from high-schoolers considering the Pre-Med track to students who are preparing to apply in the upcoming cycle. In addition to the 20+ schools giving presentations within the conference rooms throughout the Marshall Center, many schools will be on the first floor during the tabling fair for a better opportunity to potentially meet one-on-one with representatives from the school, ranging from admission officers to current Medical Students. We will also have a tour of Morsani College of Medicine towards the end of the forum. \\n\\nThis is an all day event, with both breakfast and lunch costs provided in the purchase of your ticket. Dress code is at least business casual for the event.  Every attendee will receive a FREE 6 month trial of ChemHelp from Kaplan Test for attending.

(April 3rd- 14th, 2017)\\n\\nCentre Gallery is pleased to present Wild Strawberries a solo print exhibition by Amra Causevic. A recent graduate from the University of South Florida with a Bachelor’s degree in Studio Art, Causevic uses printmaking as a medium to visually transcribe her other sculptural works, similarly as a screenplay to a movie.  The work opens a discussion about fleeting connections and moments within a fragmented narratives, where a conceptual timeline is deeply considered while it invites the viewer to ponder a series of events which have and might not have taken place.  These etchings act as absurd photographic documentation, which discuss the materiality of a human experience as the holder and keeper of necessary and indispensable things, and its relationships encountered over time.  In Wild Strawberries, the use of copper embodies a level of antiquity and longevity which permeates in the prints by revealing imperfections and time experienced through the etching process. \\n\\nOur opening reception, DesART, will be the first Monday of the show April 3rd from 12-1 pm.

In this display, the artists will be showcasing their study of the significance of experience throughout periods of creation and its unique characteristics as it relates to themselves. These works are visual studies of the artist's influence on their surroundings.\\n\\nAlejandra Gotera and Carolyn Pacheco’s work demonstrates a period of exploration of the intuitive process and personal dialogue between artist and material. Both artists highlight their value of fluid intuition and color in their work collectively. Gotera places an emphasis on exploring control and the natural structures created through the spontaneity of the medium, while Pacheco focus’ on her intuitive reactions to her materials while having an underlying fixation with playing with negative space in her compositions. Gotera works primarily with acrylics in her work, reflecting a subconscious theme of chaos, balance and emotion. Pacheco delves in various mediums more commonly those of intangibility in her past installation and performance pieces, but has taken a liking to watercolor, graphite, and paper in these most recent mixed media paintings.\\n\\nOur opening reception, DesART, will be the first Monday of the show January 23 rd from 12-1 pm.

On Monday, May 1st 2017, a student was raped by LaDarrius Jackson in her dorm room. http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/usf-football-player-ladarrius-jackson-arrested-on-sexual-battery-charge/2322367 The University has a track record of not addressing their students when these crimes occur. There have been multiple email campagins to send to USF admin and this is no different. I have posted a sample letter to email to USF admin in hopes of holding them accountable and forcing them to send out a response to their students addressing this most recent event. We hope that they respond in favor of the survivor and with compassion. In order for this to work I hope that you personalize the sample email below and send it to each of the emails provided. After you're done I encourage you to invite more people to do the same. Let's flood the inboxes and hold the institution accountable. My heart is with the survivor and I hope no one is silenced by institutions in the future. \\n\\nEmail:\\nDanielle McDonald\\nAssistant Vice President & Dean of Students \\ndmcdonald@usf.edu\\n\\nWinston Jones\\nInterim Associate Dean of Students\\nwinstonjones@usf.edu\\n\\nSujit Chembukar\\nInterim Assistant Dean/Director Marshall Student Center \\nsujit@usf.edu\\n\\nJose Hernandez, Chief Diversity Officer, DIEO\\njehernan@usf.edu\\n\\nUSF President Contact\\ncvisot@usf.edu\\n\\nMr. Johnny Prugh\\nSpecial Assistant to the President\\njprugh@usf.edu\\n\\nMark Harlan\\nDirector of Athletics\\nmarkharlan@usf.edu\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTo Whom It May Concern,\\n\\tI am writing this letter to you today in response to the recent rape that happened on the University of South Florida- Tampa campus. On Monday, May 1st 2017 a student was raped in their dorm room by LaDarrious Jackson. Jackson was arrested at 10:30 p.m. by University police and charged with sexual assault/sexual battery on a person 18 or older and false imprisonment/kidnapping of an adult and held without bond. \\n\\t\\nThis event may sound very familiar because students have been raped on campus before and the university has failed to respond to these crimes adequately. How institutions respond to rape on campus is unacceptable. These institutions run bureaucratically, their business can’t have a bad reputation, so these institutions try as hard as they can to not bring light to the horrendous crimes that happen on campus, more specifically, rape. What parent would want to send their beloved children to live and attend an institution where rapes occur and are not properly addressed? This instills an all-too-familiar rape culture on college campuses. \\n\\t\\nUSF has an electronic messaging system that they use to send text messages or emails to their students when an event like an armed robbery happens on campus. They have failed, on this occasion and many others to send such messages warning their students of a sexual assault. They have also failed to send a follow up response to the rape that happen on campus. This has happened before and USF only seems to respond when they get a flood of emails putting pressure on them to address it. As a ***STUDENT, FACULTY MEMBER, MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY, SURVIVOR, DONOR, ALUM, ETC*** I am concerned and disappointed. \\n\\t\\nBecause USF takes so much pride in their “consent campaign” I expect that the institution address rape with compassion and passion in favor of the survivor, I have been proven wrong. I am both upset and angry that these events keep happening on campus and on college campuses as well as how USF fails to respond to rape on campus. I hope that the university chooses to do the right thing and address the rape that happened on Monday, May 1st 2017 in favor and in support of the survivor. \\n\\nThank You,\\n(***STUDENT, FACULTY MEMBER, MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY, SURVIVOR, DONOR, ALUM, ETC***)\", 'Sarah Zaharako', '158492561238612']\n",

Following his award-winning turn on his hometown of Dodge City, Dragging Wyatt Earp, Rebein takes us back to the high plains world where his family has farmed and ranched since the 1920s. It is a world populated by feedlot cowboys, stock car drivers, and farm kids dreaming of basketball glory. Here too we find the darker tales of damaged young men returning from war, long-haul truckers addicted to crystal meth, and the sadly heroic residents of a small-town nursing home grandiloquently named Manor of the Plains.\\n\\nWhether contemplating a fiery crash at a race track, coming to terms with an aging parent, or navigating the last days of a beloved family dog, Rebein offers a subtle, unsparing, often moving look at the moments that go into making a writer and a man. Seen in sharp detail, and recalled from a distance, his is a story of how a man can leave his home on the prairie–and yet never really get out of Dodge.\\n\\nTwo of the essays in the book, “Bullet in the Brain” and “A Fire on the Moon,” were selected by Robert Atwan as Notable Essays of the Year in the anthology The Best American Essays (2015 & 2016 editions).\\n\\nRobert Rebein teaches creative writing and chairs the English department at Indiana University Purdue University in Indianapolis. Previous essays of his have appeared in The Georgia Review, Ecotone, The Cream City Review, Redivider, and other journals and magazines. His first book, Hicks, Tribes, and Dirty Realists: American Fiction after Postmodernism, a study of the role of place in contemporary American fiction, was reissued in paperback in 2009.', 'USF College of Arts and Sciences', '140089599334463']\n",

For this exhibition, Schnur has used photography, sculpture and instillation to bring light to social and political issues that are often swept “under the rug”.\\n \\nUnder the Rug serves as a vehicle to challenge and confront the dismissive attitude of key political figures on matters of grave importance that are constantly obscured by the media. Schnur employs various techniques ranging from her photographic prints of miniature figures to her graphic ceramic sculptures or her immersive installations. She invites viewers to indulge in her form of artistic activism while engaging in activated spectatorship.\\n \\nErika Schnur is a 25 year old BFA student majoring in studio art with a concentration in\\nphotography who is graduating from USF in the fall. She plans to work within the art community of the Tampa Bay area as a fine photographer following graduation.\\n \\nArtist Statement\\n \\n“Being an artist has become like breathing for me. This aspect of me has respired life into every facet of who I am and how I look at the world. Art is my platform to make a statement, to be heard, to be an activist. It is my responsibility as an artist to say what is difficult to hear and become a beacon of light for those who have been shunned into the darkness. Art is a tool to project the voice of the oppressed, the shamed, the disregarded. Photography has allowed me to be bold in the way I speak through my work for myself, and for others. I have no interest in the projection of the notion of a utopian society since as we’ve seen it doesn’t exist and has yet to surface if it did. I do work to provoke and incite the iniquity in our society, illuminating these ignored issues through my photography.\\n \\nTo me, there is something so emotionally evocative about a photograph. No matter the subject matter of the photograph, there is a story behind each of them. This is something has always fascinated and intrigued me about photography and its ability to entice you psychologically. This aspect of photography is one I explore when connecting the manner we are influenced by visual stimuli and how it alters our thoughts and behavior.\\n \\nThe suggestively oppressive ideals are aspects of society I examine through the scope of my lens in my photographic and sculptural works. I want to turn the repressive notions that have been systematically embedded in our minds on its head to challenge and dismantle them. Art allows me to do this; being powerful and fierce with my statements without fear or censorship. Art allows me to be me, something I will never give up.”\\n\\n\\nThe gallery is open Monday - Thursday, 11am - 3pm. DesArt will be served at 12pm on Monday, July 24 and the closing reception will take place from 7pm - 9pm on Friday, August 4.', 'Usf CentreGallery', '10152996744011158']\n",

By the end of the week, thirteen New Orleanians, black and white, had been killed. In telling the story of the 1900 riot, historians face a major obstacle: the story’s protagonist, Robert Charles, is almost entirely missing from the historical record.

This exhibit runs from August 21st through September 1st, showcasing artwork that explores themes of deterioration and rot. Inspired by the chaotic narratives documented from his dreams, Halsor creates patterns and textures dependent on these subconscious stories, while abstracting characteristics of the human body. \\nHalsor uses oil paints and chalk pastels to create loose and abstracted images of decay, with the intent of imitating the state of dreaming as his visual comprehension of these settings feels distorted and surreal. Halsor wants to focus on the dynamic qualities of how these images are understood visually, while tying back to his concentration of deterioration and absurdity in dreams present in many of his recent works. Many of these newer dream pieces link the idea of corrosion with features of the body itself. These artworks reinterpret the depiction of the body by abstracting textural qualities found within tongues, teeth, and flesh. \\n\\nDessArt will be served on Monday, August 21 from 12 p.m. - 1 p.m.\\nThe closing reception will be held on September 1st from 7-9 pm. Snacks and refreshments will be provided. \\n\\nAll Centre Gallery events are free and open to the public.', 'Centre Gallery USF', '595477540623361']\n",

Nationwide, Delta Epsilon Psi is making history daily and one day plans to be legendary amongst our schools and communities. To accomplish this, however, we will need men who share such a vision of success. If you feel that you can be a valuable asset to an organization or if you are willing and able to learn how to become a leader, then live DEPsi.\\n\\nWhat is a bid?\\n- A bid is an invitation to enter the new membership intake program and continue on the path to becoming a Brother. Bids are given at the end of the recruitment week to interests that the Brothers feel would be a good fit with our fraternity. You are not obligated to accept a bid if given one; recruitment week is non-committal. In order to be eligible for a bid, interests must attend two recruitment events, one informational, and one service event.\\n***************************** ΔEΨ *****************************\\n\\nWhy Delta Epsilon Psi?\\n- \"We don\\'t turn boys into men, we turn men into leaders.\" Our goals are structured both for the growth of the Fraternity and the individual. Additionally, our extensive social involvement and campus leadership allows us to stay on top of campus wide events. We aim to provide a basic network for members to succeed academically and to unite members closer to the community, transcending religious and regional barriers within our community. Delta Epsilon Psi was not created to separate a group from the whole, but rather to instill the ideas of a whole into a body of unified men.\\nGaining the Academic Advantage\\n- One of the main concerns of Delta Epsilon Psi is excelling in academics. We work together to help ensure academic excellence through the institution of group study sessions, tutoring, and the instilling of time management skills.\\nTraining Leaders for the Future\\n- Delta Epsilon Psi trains and develops leaders for the next generation. Our elusive network and mentoring give you the edge in development, and how to succeed. We teach you what it takes to organize your time, excel academically, and develop into an integral member of any community. Once you become a part of Delta Epsilon Psi, failure is no longer an option.\\nGreeks in Leadership Positions\\n- All but two Presidents since 1825\\n- 76% of US Congressmen\\n- 70% of all physicians\\n- 85% of Fortune 500 Executives\\nExtensive Alumni Support To Gain A Competitive Advantage in the Job Market\\n- The Alumni Network Association of Delta Epsilon Psi is ready to help you get your feet into the job market. Our Alumni are professionals in a wide range of fields such as Medicine, Business, Law, Engineering, and Arts and are employed with companies such as Microsoft, Dell, Halliburton, TI Instruments, HP, Nortel, Accenture, Calpine, Lockheed Martin, Reliant, IBM and many others. A number of Brothers can provide the inside hand to getting to where you want. Through our guidance, mentoring, and support network, you will have the proverbial upper hand.\\n\\n***************************** ΔEΨ *****************************\\nSince the establishment of Delta Epsilon Psi, the men of Theta Chapter have continued to use the Founding Father\\'s visions as their stepping stones to build a brotherhood of leaders. With the principles of Brotherhood, Discipline, and Commitment, the brothers of the Theta Chapter have worked with determination and passion to create a fraternal organization that not only strives for growth in itself, but the personal growth of each brother and the community that they are a part of.\\n\\nSome of the events hosted by Theta Chapter:\\n-Sugarfree Bowl\\n-Dodging Diabetes\\n-Sugar Spike Off\\n-Blue and Silver service event\\n-Cakin with DEPsi and LTAs\\nSome Achievements:\\n-Received chapter status on July 24th, 2005\\n-1st place in APIA Unity Mixer\\'s stroll competition\\n-Chapter of the year in 2013\\n-Nationally recognized sponsor for JDRF\\n-Nationally recognized sponsor of Be-The-Match Bone Marrow Registry\\n-Raised $31,716 in 2015-2016\\n- Theta Chapter alone donated $2,632.30 to JDRF this past spring semester\\n\\n****************************** ΔEΨ ****************************\\nFor More Information Visit\\nhttp://deltaepsilonpsi.org/ -National Website\\nhttp://www.depsitheta.org/ - Chapter Website\\nFollow us on Instagram @DEPsi_Theta', 'DEPsi - USF - Theta Chapter', '351593770442']\n",

This exhibit runs from August 21st through September 1st, showcasing artwork that explores themes of deterioration and rot. Inspired by the chaotic narratives documented from his dreams, Halsor creates patterns and textures dependent on these subconscious stories, while abstracting characteristics of the human body. \\nHalsor uses oil paints and chalk pastels to create loose and abstracted images of decay, with the intent of imitating the state of dreaming as his visual comprehension of these settings feels distorted and surreal. Halsor wants to focus on the dynamic qualities of how these images are understood visually, while tying back to his concentration of deterioration and absurdity in dreams present in many of his recent works. Many of these newer dream pieces link the idea of corrosion with features of the body itself. These artworks reinterpret the depiction of the body by abstracting textural qualities found within tongues, teeth, and flesh. \\n\\nThe closing reception will be held on September 1st from 7-9 pm. \\n\\nAll Centre Gallery events are free and open to the public.', 'Centre Gallery USF', '595477540623361']\n",

Stucchio’s hand building, glazing, and finishing processes result in amorphous gobs of flesh tones, skin textures, and human hairs.\\nThe objects, though vaguely human, exist separate from a defined human figure. In isolation, bodily characteristics that may conventionally appear repulsive or taboo lose their context. Liberated from the human figure, the masses of curves, rolls, and selectively placed hairs circumvent cultural expectations that dictate what is socially desired for a body to display and challenge viewers to consider their attitudes toward “undesirable” attributes in and of themselves. A close examination of the works may yield any number of responses from disgust to self-consciousness, or even delight in the case of observers finding elements that relate to their own bodies elevated as elements of fine art.\\n\\nStucchio’s placement of the objects in the exhibition further distances specific fleshy occurrences from the figural form. Despite existing within a formal art space, the works in Smoosh abide by no conventional display criteria. Viewers encounter the abstract forms at varying heights and planes throughout the gallery, prompting them to be mindful of their own bodies as they navigate around not only the flesh-resembling sculptures, but the bodies of other viewers as well.  Depending both on the viewers present and on which works have a tendency to repel or attract, engagement with the exhibition and the aesthetic and spatial relationships that arise between the works themselves and the humans that approach the works constantly shift. This shifting adds to the destabilization of one’s perception of the particular bodily phenomena represented and recontextualized in the work. \\n\\nStucchio earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in ceramics from the University of South Florida where she earned a Talent Grant and participated in multiple group exhibitions. Since graduating she has shown throughout the Tampa Bay area at galleries including Portspace and Tempus Projects.  \\n\\nThe Centre Gallery is located on the second floor of the Marshall Student Center at the University of South Florida Tampa campus. There will be an opening reception for Smoosh on Tuesday, September 5 from 12pm to 1pm, and a closing reception on Friday, September 15 from 7pm to 9pm. \\n\\nAll gallery events are open and free to the public.\\nThe gallery will be open Monday - Friday, 11am - 5pm.\\n\\nFor more information, please contact the artist at ginastucchio@gmail.com.', 'Centre Gallery USF', '595477540623361']\n",

Presented by Dean Bell, Ph.D., Provost and Vice President, Spertus Institute for Jewish Learning and Leadership. \\n\\nA revolutionary figure in world history, Martin Luther, frequently discussed Judaism and the Jews in his numerous and influential writings. For Luther, these topics were central to his understanding of theology, politics, and history. On the 500th Anniversary (Oct 31, 2017) of his famous “95 Theses,” this lecture examines the reformer’s writings about Judaism and the Jews in the context of his society and his own thought.

Each event for #JE10 is themed after a different crystal for its association with values such as creativity, strength, dedication, and love, which we all see represented in the USF and larger AAPI community.\\nIn celebration of a Decade of Diversity, the 10th Executive Board and 15 of your favorite Asian student organzations are honored to invite you to Journey to the East 2017!\\n\\n× × × × × × × × × × \\n*All events are FREE and are NOT Asian-exclusive!*\\n\\n💠 MONDAY  // TASTE OF ASIA 💠\\nSeptember 25 | 5-7:00PM | Amphitheatre\\nOPAL Associated with originality and dynamic diversity\\nHelp us kick off #JE10 right and join us for FREE food!

      "[142873329665567, 'Art-de facto opposition by Serhat Tanyolacar', 'Tampa, FL (Oct. 16 – Oct. 27, 2017)\\n \\nCentre Gallery is pleased to present Art – de Facto Opposition, a solo exhibition by Serhat Tanyolaçar. The exhibition is on view from October 16 - 27, 2017.\\n\\nLike the mythological figure of Atlas, Serhat Tanyolaçar bears the weight of pervasive moral and political corruption on his shoulders. Turkish by birth and culture and U.S. resident since 2002, Tanyolaçar learned early that the ambiguous symbols of institutions often cloak a rigid adherence to authority that is at odds with personal liberty. His work skewers that authority with absurdity, satire, humor, and anguished meanings.\\n \\nTanyolaçar believes that it is artists’ obligation to be socially and politically responsible active human beings. He takes the role of the oppositional figure against the established government and societal systems.  This, in a way, transforms him into a socio-political commentator and a storyteller. \\n \\nTanyolaçar’s exhibition at the Centre Gallery of the University of South Florida presents his latest prints and his kaftan attire from his last public performance in Istanbul and Ankara. Worthy of close looking for both their imagery and content, his prints linger in the mind as intriguing and peculiar, compelling and exasperating. \\n\\nTanyolacar’s new media prints have black, densely detailed, and embossed surfaces. On the computer, he adds and layers images and surfaces, crossing borders literally and figuratively. He then transfers the finished images to a laser engraver to create relief printmaking blocks. The wood itself-the grain, the brownish stain- adds an organic depth to the prints. He is a masterful printmaker, producing just a few exquisite prints from each block. He is certainly not pumping out broadsides for the masses.\\n\\nTanyolacar explains the centrepiece, The Death of Innocence with a moral and ethical dichotomy, which allows the occurring of most political corruption. For him, Trump is just a symbol, which reflects our own bipolar morality, our fears, greed and the facades and determinants of the socio-economic classes. The second part of the print displays poets who are well known for their love poems.  The constant disruption leaves the viewer questioning the inclusion of every element, attempting to generate relationships between the components, and wondering what went missing in the process.  \\n \\nAs a manifesto of individual artistic freedom against authoritarian rules, Tanyolacar’s work pushes the question, “what can we accept?” Like a modern-day Goya, his prints may not make sense at the first glance, but they stop us in our tracks, pull us in, deny us complacency, and demand that we attend to the folly all around. \\n \\nThe Centre Gallery is located on the second floor of the MSC and  will be open Monday – Friday, 11 a.m. – 5 p.m. DessArt will be served on Monday, October 16, 12 p.m. – 1 p.m. The Closing reception will be held on October 27, 7 p.m. – 9 p.m.\\n \\nAll Centre Gallery events are free and open to the public.', 'Centre Gallery USF', '595477540623361']\n",

That’s the case for black women in the United States, who are paid 63 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. \\n\\n#BlackWomensEqualPay Day, which takes place on July 31, is the symbolic day when black women’s earnings “catch up” to white men’s earnings from the previous year. Join us in observing the date by calling for action and equality!\\n\\nWHAT'S THE DEAL?\\n\\nNationally, women of all races working full time, year-round are paid 80 percent of what men are paid. The pay gap affects all women, but it doesn’t affect all women equally. Age, race, and education level all play a role. \\n\\nThe percentage of black women who are full-time minimum-wage workers is higher than that of any other racial group. Black women make up a scant 1 percent of the high-paying engineering workforce and 3 percent of computing. And when 70 percent of black mothers serve as the primary or sole breadwinner in their family, every penny counts.

Heart of Vietnam is VSA’s largest charity banquet of the year and will take place on Sunday, October 22nd at 7:00 pm. Join us for a night of dazzling performances at the Marshall Student Center Ballroom and learn more about Vietnamese culture. \\n…………………………………………………………………………\\nWHAT IS HEART OF VIETNAM?\\n\\nHeart of Vietnam is an annual charity banquet held in Fall by the Vietnamese Student Association at the University of South Florida. Our event celebrates Vietnamese culture with support and collaboration from the local Vietnamese community, other VSA organizations statewide, and countless student organization passionately involved in the Asian American community at USF. Heart of Vietnam offers a memorable night of cultural showcases and meaningful performances from local performers, featuring one special guest headliner, and accompanied by authentic Vietnamese food. Proceeds from tickets sales and donations go towards our philanthropy, which was decided by the Union of North American Vietnamese Students of America (UNAVSA) for all VSA’s across the nation. The chosen charity for this year is the Pacific Links Foundation.\\n…………………………………………………………………………\\nWHAT IS THE PACIFIC LINKS FOUNDATIONS?\\n\\nPacific Links Foundation (PALS), or Vòng Tay Thái Bình in Vietnamese, is a volunteer-based foundation that counters human trafficking in Vietnam by providing increased access to education, shelter, reintegration services, and economic opportunities in regions most vulnerable to human trafficking. Vietnam is a primary source for the human trafficking of women and children, which Pacific Links Foundation combats by creating sustainable and developed communities, promoting the development of skills and expertise, and empowering women for social change. Several initiatives have been established since 2001 that address the needs of early childhood education in underdeveloped and rural communities, provide scholarships to at-risk girls, and empower women through advocacy and leadership skills. The Pacific Links Foundation puts every donation toward helping individuals live safe, successful lives that are free from human trafficking.\\n………………………………………………………………………\\nWHAT IS THE THEME?\\n\\nThe theme for the 10th Annual Heart of Vietnam is REFLECTION. “Everything that happens to us is a reflection of who we are,” says Deepak Chopra. Who we are as a person is shaped by many important factors, including our heritage and our self-respect for where we come from. To celebrate our 10th annual banquet, VSA would like to reflect upon, not only the journey to Heart of Vietnam, but also the journey that many of the great previous generations have conquered to give young generations the lives to live, to learn, and to remember the glorious history that was left behind in order for us as Asian American Pacific Islanders to grow while shining the roots within. \\n………………………………………………………………………\\nWHAT IS THE ENTRANCE FEE?\\n\\nThe entrance fee to Heart of Vietnam is $10 for general admission and $15 for VIP admission. VIP guests will be offered seating closer to the performances and the stage, a greater variety of dinner choices, and a meet and greet opportunity with our guest headliner. Proceeds from ticket sales will be directly donated to the Pacific Links Foundations! \\n\\nTicket prices will be $12 for general admission and $17 for VIP admission at the door, so don\\'t forget to grab your tickets in advance.

Although initial drug reform policies from the 1970s and 80s were well intentioned, bi-partisan policies, the US prison population has grown by over 700% since that time. Additionally, the US Department of Justice reports that federal recidivism rates are as high as 77% — meaning that 7 in 10 people who are incarcerated return to the prison system within three years of release. Yet, the US spends over $80 billion per year on incarceration (and, most often, of nonviolent drug offenders).

No two glazes look the same, either in color, crystal size, and/or crystal location. This lack of control is what creates a natural curiosity every time a new kiln load is finished. It is with high hopes that each piece conveys that same genuine excitement and curiosity to the viewer.\\n           \\nThe process behind the glazes is a complex system of steps to help the crystals grow. Although it may look like two glazes, there is actually only one glaze on the vessel. The crystals grow within the glaze, which is what makes these glazes so special. These particular sets of glazes are known as zinc oxide macro-crystalline glazes. This means that the crystals can be seen with the naked eye and that they are comprised of the compound zinc oxide and inorganic derivative of the element Zinc. The zinc oxide is crucial to the formation of the crystals; it forms the cores of the crystal within the glaze. However, the zinc crystal will only grow if the glaze is held a specific temperature for a set amount of time. If this does not happen then no crystals will grow. The glazes themselves are fired to the 2350°F, also known as cone 10 in the ceramics world. The holds in temperature must occur after the glaze has reached cone ten, as the crystals must grow in a molten environment.\\n \\nAlong with the materials for the crystalline glaze, there are materials to change the color of the crystal and the areas with no crystal, referenced in layman’s terms as the background color. Specific materials will enhance the crystalline glazes and alter their color. For deep blue crystals and background color with a metallic shimmer, a combination of cobalt and manganese is used. For a light blue crystal with a bright orange background color, the usage of nickel is employed. However, many of the colorants are toxic, which only adds to the complexity of the glazes. It is this complexity in both firing systems and glaze synthesis that makes this family of glazes so daunting, yet intriguing.\\n \\nThe Gallery will be open Monday – Friday, 11 a.m. – 5 p.m. DessArt will be served on Monday, November 13, 12 p.m. – 1 p.m. The Closing reception will be held on December 1, 7 p.m. – 9 p.m.\\n \\nAll Centre Gallery events are free and open to the public.', 'Centre Gallery USF', '595477540623361']\n",

Each piece is made with perfection in mind; creating a difficult task as the glazes are so unpredictable. The desire to create curiosity in the viewer comes from the very nature of these glazes. No two glazes look the same, either in color, crystal size, and/or crystal location. This lack of control is what creates a natural curiosity every time a new kiln load is finished. It is with high hopes that each piece conveys that same genuine excitement and curiosity to the viewer.\\n            \\nThe process behind the glazes is a complex system of steps to help the crystals grow. Although it may look like two glazes, there is actually only one glaze on the vessel. The crystals grow within the glaze, which is what makes these glazes so special. These particular sets of glazes are known as zinc oxide macro-crystalline glazes. This means that the crystals can be seen with the naked eye and that they are comprised of the compound zinc oxide and inorganic derivative of the element Zinc. The zinc oxide is crucial to the formation of the crystals; it forms the cores of the crystal within the glaze. However, the zinc crystal will only grow if the glaze is held a specific temperature for a set amount of time. If this does not happen then no crystals will grow. The glazes themselves are fired to the 2350°F, also known as cone 10 in the ceramics world. The holds in temperature must occur after the glaze has reached cone ten, as the crystals must grow in a molten environment. \\n \\nAlong with the materials for the crystalline glaze, there are materials to change the color of the crystal and the areas with no crystal, referenced in layman’s terms as the background color. Specific materials will enhance the crystalline glazes and alter their color. For deep blue crystals and background color with a metallic shimmer, a combination of cobalt and manganese is used. For a light blue crystal with a bright orange background color, the usage of nickel is employed. However, many of the colorants are toxic, which only adds to the complexity of the glazes. It is this complexity in both firing systems and glaze synthesis that makes this family of glazes so daunting, yet intriguing. \\n \\nThe Gallery will be open Monday – Friday, 11 a.m. – 5 p.m. DessArt will be served on Monday, November 13, 12 p.m. – 1 p.m. The Closing reception will be held on December 1, 7 p.m. – 9 p.m.\\n \\nAll Centre Gallery events are free and open to the public.', 'Centre Gallery USF', '595477540623361']\n",

      "[431124367289920, 'Weekend', 'Weekend, Curated by Ezra Johnson \\nReception, December 2, 6-9pm\\nLibations served\\n\\nDecember 2 – January 13, 2018\\n\\nMaria Calandra, Andy Cross, Jules De Balincourt, Erik den Breejen, Franklin Evans, Sue Havens, James Hyde, Samuel Jablon, Ezra Johnson, Dominique Labauvie, David McBride, Emily Noelle Lambert, Kristen Schiele, Jered Sprecher, Wendy White\\n\\nImage: Kristen Schiele, “Love Me Indigo\" 52\"x56\" acrylic, oil on canvas 2017\\n\\nWhen I first thought of using the title Weekend it was before the election and I was excited to put together a bold, colorful and energetic exhibition, a celebration or an extended party in a warm and exotic location. I thought of inviting my favorite artists as if inviting my favorite people for a weekend escape in the countryside.\\n\\nThen the election happened and I’ve become hesitant about making a show with a theme of celebration or joy. However, it occurs to me that Weekend can be a more expansive concept, with the possibility of pleasure and communion as well as destruction. It is also worth remembering that the five-day workweek with a weekend break was a hard fought victory for workers rights.\\n\\nPretty much overnight we have become witnesses of civilization crashing and burning around us. Many of us will go inward to find expression of personal visions. Others might react directly to the shocking events, which we hear about in the media daily. I have often struggled personally about what my responsibility as an artist is. I believe artists shouldn’t feel compelled to make topical works unless they are fulfilling a deep personal need for such expression. I often think of Matisse’s response to the hopelessness of the First World War by painting his normally light window in black.\\n\\nThis exhibition will serve as a jumping off point – a collegial gathering of artists trying to make sense of a world gone slightly askew. \\n\\nEzra Johnson, Curator\\n\\nAbout the Artists:\\nMaria Calandra was born in London, UK in 1976. She lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. She is the artist and writer behind the blog Pencil in the Studio, which she started in 2011. In this new body of work, originated during a retreat on the coast of Maine, Calandra is tapping into her subconscious to convey affections for the natural world, using automatic drawing as a more direct approach to capture nature’s spirit. Calandra holds a BFA from Ohio University and received an MFA from Cornell University in 2006. She has shown in both New York City and across the United States previously exhibiting with Andrew Edlin Gallery, Shrine Gallery, Romeo, White Columns, Arts and Leisure, Geoffrey Young Gallery and Sardine.\\n\\nAndy Cross was born in Richmond, Virginia in 1979.

In Boston with Mario Diacono at Ars Libri, and internationally with the Max Mara, Marramotti Family Collection.

He is an artist and poet who lives and works in New York City. Jablon’s work explores the discursive and sensual visuality of art and poetry and the ways in which these forms serve as sources of disinformation and openness.

He lives and works in Brooklyn, NY and received his MFA degree from Hunter College in 2004. McBride’s paintings focus on an interplay between traditional oil glazing techniques in painting and methods of mass reproduction, and formally may be recalled as paintings of black and white photographic imagery. McBride often deals with imagery associated with innocuous events and objects than somehow manage to retain a hold on our consciousness. His work has been exhibited at Lesley Heller Workspace, Common Room, New York, NY; curated by Bjoern Meyer-Ebrecht. Rise, Brooklyn, NY; curated by Lynn Sullivan. The Onerdonx Archive, Scholes Library, Alfred University, Alfred NY. Common Room, Brooklyn, NY. Andy’s Room, 57 W 57 Arts; curated by Andy Robertson.

Storefront Gallery, Dunkle Wolke, Brooklyn, NY; curated by William Powhida\\n\\nKristen Schiele was born in Houston, Texas in 1970. Her paintings weave poetic tableaus from the fabric of pop and movie culture.

Schiele holds a BA in Visual arts from Indiana University, a masters degree from the American University in Washington DC, and has studied at the Universitat der Kunste Berlin. Her work has been exhibited at the Torrence Art Museum, Corcoran Museum of Art, Portland Institute for Comtemporary Art, Nathalie Karg Gallery in NY, Freight and Volume Gallert in NY, Gallery Poulsen in Copenhagen, PS1 Moma and The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA Book Fair and The Soap Factory in Minneapolis. Her work was recently added to the Whitney Museum of Art and Metropolitan Musuem of Art collections. She lives and works in Brooklyn.\\n\\nJered Sprecher was born in Lincoln Nebraska in 1976. His paintings compress time into the surface and touch of painting, that old technology. Flora, fauna, and natural phenomenon combine with intricate painterly structures, “bits of day-to-day life, seen through the glow of the digital screen are the genesis of my work.” Sprecher lives and works in Knoxville, TN. He holds a BA from Concordia University and an MFA from the University of Iowa. Sprecher is a recipient of a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship (2009-10) and has had residencies at the Marie Walsh Sharpe Space Program in Manhattan (2003-4), the Irish Museum of Modern Art (2007), and the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas (2013).

Currently, Sprecher is a Professor of Art at The University of Tennessee. He has taught at The University of Iowa, Princeton, and Cornell University.\\n\\nWendy White was born in 1971 in Deep River, Connecticut. Her work explores the boundaries between painting, sculpture, and installation, by employing nostalgic symbols in a way that lures the viewer into a pictorial haze to examine an unfolding story. Just as the skaters and surfers of the 1980s had their specific vocabulary, White presents a lexicon of new iconography repeated throughout the exhibition. Her graphic stenciled rain clouds, hearts, and rainbows take on new meaning, acting as stickers that unify adolescent skateboard fantasies with a Lisa Frank-like pseudo-reality. White has exhibited in galleries and museums internationally including Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts, Stockholm; Museum of Fine Arts, Gifu, Japan; M Woods, Beijing, China; Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts, Omaha; and Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art.', 'Mindy Solomon Gallery', '110087982697']\n",

The showcase is a collection of works by four emerging artists at the University of South Florida, who all come from different parts of the world. The viewer will be exposed to sculpture, ceramics, drawing, printmaking and painting.\\n\\nDiana Fridelova is a Slovakian-Cuban artist that concentrates her work on the exploration of transformation through various media pieces inspired by water. It is through this element that Diana shows the struggle one undergoes to achieve a responsiveness and state of adaptation towards life and oneself.\\nDyron Lafuente is a Cuban-born artist that creates varied pieces that bend towards issues of individual conflict, that reflect on his personal experiences. His upbringing in Spain and his migration through Europe to come to the United States exposed him to opposing world views, which dictate the way he perceives and expresses art. His theme focuses on world issues that people try to ignore because they are often grotesque in nature. He places his pieces into a space where the viewer is forced to see and experience the pain that war, and the clashing of different cultures causes. He also leaves the window of perception open to the viewer through simplistic abstracted forms, as he is fascinated with how individuals will make their own connections with the work to the world.  \\nEmily Rojas, is a Dominican-American artist, who bases her work upon self-reflecting experiences. Her versatility is evident in her work, as she often illustrates her ideas through various media including printmaking, drawing and sculpture. She explores themes that pertain to the complexity of the human mind as it produces the negative influences of fear and her search on self-identity. She is currently exploring African and Latin cultures and the role they play within her own culture.\\nJuan Pablo Sierra is a Colombian-born artist whose body of work is comprised of his life experiences, in addition to his own personal interests and ideals. His art deals with current issues within society and the perception of reality through his eyes, believing that life is ever-changing, and it is in a constant state of evolution and transcendence. Juan expresses himself through drawing, sculpture, painting, and printmaking in addition to experimenting with combinations of various methods to produce mixed media pieces.\\nOur opening reception, DessART, will be the first Monday of the show Jan. 8th from 12-1 pm.

So how has he maintained a grip on a segment of the Republican base that – at least, for now – seems unshakable? And how has his support persisted, despite the fact that some have called him a demagogue and a fascist, or that political observers have found parallels between him and polarizing figures like George Wallace, Joseph McCarthy, Father Coughlin – even Hitler? As a scholar of American political rhetoric, Mercieca will discuss the use and abuse of rhetorical strategy in public discourse. Scrutinizing Trump’s rhetorical skills can partially explain his profound and persistent appeal.\\n \\nDr. Jennifer Mercieca is an historian of American political rhetoric. She writes about American political discourse, especially as it relates to citizenship, democracy, and the presidency.  She is Associate Professor in the Department of Communication at Texas A&M University, Founding Director of the Aggie Agora, Immediate Past Chair of the Public Address Division of the National Communication Association, founding editor of Citizen Critics, and creator of the #teamrhetoric hashtag on Twitter. \\n\\nThis is part of the Democracy in the Post-Truth Era Lecture Series.

The event is free and open to the public. \\n\\nXin Song’s artist talk and workshop offers an opportunity to experience the popular traditional Chinese folk art of paper cutting (originally called Jianzhi). Xin Song embraces traditional Chinese paper-cutting, long considered a folk art chiefly used in decorating windows and doors on festive occasions. Trained in traditional Chinese arts and crafts at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, she moved to New York in 2000, where she incorporated collage methods into her work by introducing magazine pages into her paper-cutting practice. The magazine pages are pointedly selected to contain meanings relevant to her respective subjects, thus going beyond the form’s principally decorative function. Among Xin Song’s most notable public installations in New York City are a permanent MTA work for the Bay Parkway Landmark Station (D Line) Brooklyn; On Paper/Grand Central at 100, decorating Grand Central Terminal Dining Concourse (2013-14); and site-specific installations at Broadway Plaza (between 36th and 41st streets) and in the Flatiron building. \\n\\nXin Song will discuss major projects, after which she will demonstrate paper cutting.

There will be free cake and drinks, so come out and enjoy our new exhibition!\\nWe are located on the second floor of the Marshall Student Center.\\n-----------------\\nTampa, FL (Jan. 22 – Feb. 2, 2018)\\n\\nThe capitalist market system often exploits workers. This observation is particularly relevant in regard to the “rag trade,” as those in the field refer to the fashion industry. Betsy Orbe Lester explores fashion, the ultimate disguise, as she questions the dichotomy between the well-heeled and shoeless Joes and Janes. Fashion her trigger, she seeks cultural icons: embedding meaning in, and from, the media, to lock in her reality. Her current mixed media work appropriates Vogue spreads of pseudo rags for the rich and famous: trendy rip-offs from the impoverished and homeless. Madison Ave, dictator of the latest fashion trends, markets to vacuous forms waiting to be filled. And like Midas, the rag trade plays to the emotionally homeless, turning all it touches to gold, regardless of the human cost.\\n \\nRose Marie Prins grew up in apartheid-era South Africa, working in fashion and advertising. Her early years were marked indelibly by the inequities she witnessed. The extreme wealth and poverty, riches and rags, she saw on trips to India and Mexico are often the result of exploitation and corruption. But beauty can be found: from the fabrics of Indian women's saris, to flora and fauna, oceans and rivers, and in the colors of the earth beneath our feet. These experiences inspired her current mixed media work. In spite of pollution and poverty she found consolation in beauty. “Beauty is… the way in which the Gods touch our senses, reach the heart and attract us into life,” James Hillman reminds us. After suffering a devastating loss in 2016, it is beauty, in part, that drew her back into life.\\n\\nViewed together Lester’s and Prins’ work, with its multitude of media and metaphor, is an embarrassment of riches. Thus they create works that celebrate our cultural warp and weft as well as investigate the wealth, and value, of life’s experiences.\\n\\nOur opening reception, DessART, will be the first Monday of the show Jan. 22nd from 12-1 pm. Dessert and refreshments will be provided. The Closing Reception will be held on Friday, Feb. 2 from 7-9 pm. Snacks and refreshments will be provided.

The viewer will be exposed to sculpture, ceramics, drawing, printmaking and painting.\\n\\nDiana Fridelova is a Slovakian-Cuban artist that concentrates her work on the exploration of transformation through various media pieces inspired by water. It is through this element that Diana shows the struggle one undergoes to achieve a responsiveness and state of adaptation towards life and oneself.\\nDyron Lafuente is a Cuban-born artist that creates varied pieces that bend towards issues of individual conflict, that reflect on his personal experiences. His upbringing in Spain and his migration through Europe to come to the United States exposed him to opposing world views, which dictate the way he perceives and expresses art. His theme focuses on world issues that people try to ignore because they are often grotesque in nature. He places his pieces into a space where the viewer is forced to see and experience the pain that war, and the clashing of different cultures causes. He also leaves the window of perception open to the viewer through simplistic abstracted forms, as he is fascinated with how individuals will make their own connections with the work to the world. \\nEmily Rojas, is a Dominican-American artist, who bases her work upon self-reflecting experiences. Her versatility is evident in her work, as she often illustrates her ideas through various media including printmaking, drawing and sculpture. She explores themes that pertain to the complexity of the human mind as it produces the negative influences of fear and her search on self-identity. She is currently exploring African and Latin cultures and the role they play within her own culture.\\nJuan Pablo Sierra is a Colombian-born artist whose body of work is comprised of his life experiences, in addition to his own personal interests and ideals. His art deals with current issues within society and the perception of reality through his eyes, believing that life is ever-changing, and it is in a constant state of evolution and transcendence. Juan expresses himself through drawing, sculpture, painting, and printmaking in addition to experimenting with combinations of various methods to produce mixed media pieces.\\nOur opening reception, DessART, will be the first Monday of the show Jan. 8th from 12-1 pm. Dessert and refreshments will be provided. The Closing Reception will be held on Friday, Jan 19th from 7-9 pm. Snacks and refreshments will be provided. All Centre Gallery exhibits and receptions are free and open to the public.\\n\\n\\n\\nCentre Gallery\\nUniversity of South Florida\\n4202 East Fowler Avenue, MSC 4100\\nTampa, Florida 33620\\nPhone: (813) 974-5464\\nEmail: sa-centregallery@usf.edu', 'Centre Gallery USF', '595477540623361']\n",
